<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
<section>
<h2>General</h2>
<dl>
<dt>What is Cryon?</dt>
<dd>Cryon is a quantum-resistant cryptocurrency designed to provide security and simplicity in the post-quantum era.</dd>
<dt>How can I get started with Cryon?</dt>
<dd>Start by creating a wallet using our GUI or CLI tools. Then mint test tokens, try transfers, and participate in staking and bounty programs.</dd>
<dt>Is Cryon safe to use?</dt>
<dd>Cryon employs advanced post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. However, the project is currently in testnet phase and should be used cautiously.</dd>
</dl>

<section>
<h2>Staking &amp; Rewards</h2>
<dl>
<dt>What is staking in Cryon?</dt>
<dd>Staking means locking your CRY tokens to support network security and earn rewards based on the amount and duration of staking.</dd>
<dt>How do I stake and unstake tokens?</dt>
<dd>You can stake and unstake tokens using the Cryon wallet GUI or via REST API endpoints. Rewards accumulate over staking time.</dd>
<dt>Are there any lock-up periods?</dt>
<dd>Currently, there is a minimum staking period of 7 days to receive rewards, but unstaking is possible anytime after that.</dd>
<dt>How are staking rewards calculated?</dt>
<dd>Rewards are approximately 1% of the staked amount per month, prorated by time staked.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Testnet &amp; Bounty Program</h2>
<dl>
<dt>What is the Testnet Bounty program?</dt>
<dd>A program to reward active testnet users by granting points for wallet creation, minting, transfers, and staking activity.</dd>
<dt>How do I earn bounty points?</dt>
<dd>Points are awarded for various actions on the testnet, such as creating wallets, minting tokens, transferring tokens, and staking.</dd>
<dt>What are bounty points used for?</dt>
<dd>Points may be used to qualify for airdrops or other early contributor rewards once mainnet launches.</dd>
</dl>

<section>
<h2>Wallet &amp; Usage</h2>
<dl>
<dt>How do I create a Cryon wallet?</dt>
<dd>You can create a wallet using our desktop GUI or CLI tools. The wallet securely generates and stores your keys using post-quantum cryptography.</dd>
<dt>Can I use Cryon tokens on exchanges?</dt>
<dd>Currently Cryon is in testnet phase and not listed on exchanges. Plans for liquidity and exchanges are part of the roadmap.</dd>
<dt>How can I access Cryon APIs?</dt>
<dd>The public REST API offers endpoints for balance, transaction history, minting, transfers, and staking. Authentication via JWT is required for sensitive operations.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Technology &amp; Security</h2>
<dl>
<dt>What makes Cryon quantum-resistant?</dt>
<dd>Cryon uses hash-based cryptography and Dilithium post-quantum digital signatures, avoiding vulnerable traditional cryptography.</dd>
<dt>Are private keys exposed on-chain?</dt>
<dd>No. Addresses are derived from the SHA-256 hash of the private key, which is never revealed or reconstructed on-chain.</dd>
<dt>Is Cryon audited?</dt>
<dd>The project is currently in development and testing. Security audits are planned prior to mainnet launch.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Roadmap &amp; Future</h2>
<dl>
<dt>What are the main milestones on Cryon's roadmap?</dt>
<dd>Key milestones include mainnet launch, smart contract simulation, third-party audits, token economics finalization, and decentralization.</dd>
<dt>How can I contribute to Cryon?</dt>
<dd>You can contribute by testing on the testnet, reporting issues, joining bounty programs, or contributing code on GitHub.</dd>
